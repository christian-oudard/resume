\textrm{\Large Summary}\par
\vspace{8pt}
\textsf{I solve business problems by creating clear understanding, and turning that understanding into software. I'm a computer systems generalist with over 10 years of experience, and numerous personal software projects. My areas of interest include full stack web development, databases, data analysis, and machine learning. I care deeply about communicating empathetically, in a way that respects the humanity of those I work with. Outside of software, let's talk about math, philosophy, linguistics, biomechanics, or neuroscience.}
